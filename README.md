# ChiEngine
A chess engine written in C++?

### Dataset: Cassiabase

	- Figure out how to extract and use games from this dataset
	- How will games be represented?
	- How will the board be represented?
	- How will moves be represented?
  
### Libraries:

	- i probably need to make these oops
	- rewrite python-chess in c++

### GUI:

	- Communication with common chess GUIs

### TODO:

  - [ ] Board representation (data structures, methods, etc)
    - Hybrid solution
  - [ ] Interface and communication with a GUI using UCI
  	- SCID over UCI
  - [ ] Evaluation algorithm
  - [ ] Search algorithm
  - [ ] Rewrite python-chess in C++
