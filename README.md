# ChiEngine
A chess engine written in Python. Or maybe C++?

### Dataset: Cassiabase

	- Figure out how to extract and use games from this dataset
	- How will games be represented?
	- How will the board be represented?
	- How will moves be represented?
  
### Libraries:

	- python-chess

### GUI:

	- Communication with common chess GUIs

### Important links:
- [Cassiabase Dataset](http://caissabase.co.uk/)
- [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/)
- [SCID](https://scid.sourceforge.net/)
  
### TODO:

  - [ ] Board representation (data structures, methods, etc)
    - Hybrid solution, possibly using python-chess builtin?
  - [ ] Interface and communication with a GUI using CECP or UCI
  - [ ] Evaluation algorithm
  - [ ] Search algorithm
